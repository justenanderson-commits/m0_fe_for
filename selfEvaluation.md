# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel pretty confident. 7.5/10.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
This was MUCH easier for me than the Conditionals lesson. That was really tricky. The pre-learning I've done helped me to feel pretty good about for loops... so far... :)

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Just keep practicing!

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

None for now. I'll Google if I hafta!
